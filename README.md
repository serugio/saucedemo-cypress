UI test case implementation using cypress


## To Enable CI/CD in Jenkins

1. Make sure you have installed Jenkins with following any guide like this one and make sure to install suggested plugins: https://www.jenkins.io/download/#downloading-jenkins
2. fork whis repo in your github account.
3. set credentialsId in your jenkins instance

### Note
Jenkinsfile was created in a windows machine, for this reason "bat" command is used to execute bash commands. If this job is intende to be executed in a Unix based OS, 'bat' commands should be replaced for 'sh'

### NOTE

- If you want to execute the project locally:
- make sure to download the repo 
- do checkout to 'master' branch
- execute 'npm install'
- execute 'npm run E2ETest' which is a custom command to execute the automated test case.

## ABOUT THE SOLUTION

Is the implementation of an E2E test case for the purchase flow of the https://www.saucedemo.com/ web application.
- Cypress is the chosen automation tool
- It was added support to Gherkins sintax in order to allow BDD approach. (using 'feature' 'stepDefinition' and 'pageClasess' approach.
- It was added support to typescript
- It is using mochawesome reports as reporting tool.

## ABOUT THE TESTING APPROACH
- due to the time I chosed to work with an E2E test case that covers the positive path of the purchase flow. However, the coverage can be improved adding different scenarios like (logout in the middle of the flow and then re-login, include error paths, validate that prices and taxes work as intended).
-test case design is delivered in attached file trough email.
